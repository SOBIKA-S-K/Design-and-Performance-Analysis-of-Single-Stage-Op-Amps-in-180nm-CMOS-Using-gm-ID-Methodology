📁 Project Title: CMOS Op-Amp Design Using gm/ID in 180nm Technology
🧰 Tools: Cadence Virtuoso, Spectre Simulator
📐 Design Node: 180nm CMOS

📎 Overview:
⊸ This project presents the design and simulation of a single-stage operational amplifier using the gm/ID-based analog design methodology, which offers precise and efficient transistor sizing over traditional approaches. The amplifier is designed using Cadence Virtuoso, with DC sweeps generating lookup tables for gm/ID vs Vov across NMOS and PMOS devices.

✅ Key Features:

≽ Used gm/ID methodology for sizing accuracy, reducing reliance on square-law assumptions.

≽ Enhanced analog figures of merit including CMRR, gain, and bandwidth.

≽ AC simulation verified performance improvement and bias stability.

≽ Suitable for low-power analog applications like sensor interfaces and biomedical circuits.

📈 Results:

⊛ Area reduced via short-channel sizing (~270–360nm).

⊛ CMRR and gain performance improved compared to traditional sizing.

⊛ Simulation verified correct operation under realistic 180nm PDK constraints.
